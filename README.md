## About
The project is based on [Laravel Boilerplate](https://github.com/rappasoft/laravel-boilerplate?tab=readme-ov-file). Deployment of this project is automated using docker containers. 
Four docker containers are used:
- php
- node
- nginx
- mysql

## Installation

Download the project, be sure to use the --recurse-submodules flag to download the added submodule.
```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Bogi25/gitLocal-DH.git
```
Enter the project folder and run Docker Compose:
```sh
cd gitA-DH
docker compose up
```
## Additional action
Automatic push to Registry added through Git Runner.

### Setting registry
Add the Git Runner in GitHub Settings > Actions > Runners > new self-hosted runner with the standard instructions and run:

```sh
./run.sh
```

In the project, a single Docker image is built, so prepare a repository on the local Registry:

_<DOCKER_USERNAME_LOCAL>/php-composer_

This is implemented using the project <strong>[registryme](https://github.com/Bogi25/registryme).</strong> The project is added as a submodule in the registrymy folder.

## Registrymy
<details open> <summary> Detailed description</summary>

### Installation registrymy
Run a bash script in the folder with the project start-setting.sh :
```sh
cd registryme
./start-setting.sh 
```
### Description of the bash script
That's what this bash script does:

<table>
<tr>
<td>
<strong>Importantly.</strong> Some commands require administrator rights.

--- 
1. Adds a record 127.0.0.1 registry.local Ð² /etc/hosts.
<details open>
<summary>2. Creates all necessary folders</summary>

- _data-registrymy_
- _security-settings/auth_
- _security-settings/certs_
- _/etc/docker/certs.d/registry.local_
- _/home/$username/.docker_

</details>

3. Records and encrypts login and password using htpasswd, DOCKER_USERNAME_LOCAL and DOCKER_PASSWORD_LOCAL secrets added to GitHub.
4. Creates a self-signed certificate and adds it to docker to trust them.
5. The script will interactively prompt for two parameters:

- Login, which is your `DOCKER_USERNAME_LOCAL` added as a secret in GitHub.
- Password, which is your password added as a secret `DOCKER_PASSWORD_LOCAL` in GitHub.

6. Docker restarts
7. RUN _docker compose up -d_

## Push to the Registry auto

To push to the local Registry, secrets `DOCKER_USERNAME_LOCAL` and `DOCKER_PASSWORD_LOCAL`, which were added to GitHub, are used.
The description is located in the file .github/workflows/push-local-dh.yml
Docker images are sent to the address:

_registry.local:5000 (php-composer)_

When executing the `git push` command to the repository, images will be automatically pushed to the local Registry. The build will be performed by Git Runner.
